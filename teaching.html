        <h3>COVID Pod - Hebron, Maine</h3>
        <p>In the fall of 2020 COVID was hitting hard and parents were making hard
        decissions about what to do about their children's schooling. Because of
        these decissions I had the opportunity to work with a pod of six kids. I
        had three first graders, a third, fourth, and fifth grader. My students
        all had virtual school with their teachers for a few hours in the morning.
        In the morning I was doing a lot of classroom management, helping students
        with their work, and planning for the afternoon. In the afternoon we always
        had time to do school work and then I got to do enrichment activities with them.

        style="width:150px; float: left; margin: 5px">
        We did everything from going on nature walks, to building robots, to art
        activities, to desiging boats. I worked with the students to keep all of them
        interested and engaged. Because of this unique environment where their parents
        encouraged me to expose the kids to different things and be creative and with
        such a small classroom, I was really able to try new things and see what worked.
        It special to have one-on-one time with each student and get to really know them.
        <img src="images/teaching/schedule.jpg" alt="carved large pumpkins on steps in a hallway outside our classroom"
        style="width:150px; float: right; margin: 5px">
        It allowed me to better help them with their school work and design activities
        that would be fun to each of them. We were also able to spend a lot of time
        talking about things that are important to the development of humans like
        kindness, gratititude, sharing, etc. We had time to stop after any incident
        and resolve in a productive, efficient way.
        <br><br>
        Outside of the classroom I remained very connected ot the parents. I was able
        to keep them updated on our activited through a weekely newsletter. I was also
        able to involve them in many of our afternoon activities. All of the parents
        were close by all day so we had a lot of fun pop-ins which created and even
        more fun classroom experience. It was important we call kept each other looped
        in on the happenings of the kids.
        <br><br>
        From this experience I learned a lot about the importance of classroom
        management tools, especialy when working with a broad range of ages. I
        also learned how to pick up on students' learning prefences quickly so that
        I could help them with school work in the way that worked best for them.
        Throughout the semester I learned the importance of having an open classroom
        where students feel freedom to speak their mind and have discussions.That
        semester was extremely important in my development as a teacher.

        <h3>English Teaching Assistant - Kinmen, Taiwan</h3>
        <p>
          For a year and a half I lived and worked in Kinmen, Taiwan. I was working in a
          small school (around 80 total students) with kindergardeners through
          6th graders. For most of my classes I worked closesly with an English teacher
          already at the school however I had a few solo classes as well. With
          the youngest kids we focused on the alphabet and story telling. With
          third thru sixth grade I had two main types of classes: English textbook
          classes and "culture" classes. In textbook classes we taught straight from
          their textbook or designed supplimental activites to help them better grasp
          concepts. In "culture" classes we had a lot more freedom to teach whatever
          wanted, some examples of topics included holidays, friendship, shopping, and
          even cooking!
          <img src="images/teaching/cooking.jpg" alt="two students faced away from us cooking in a pot"
          style="width:150px; float: left; margin: 5px">
          <br><br>
          Every week I would meet with each of my co-teachers to plan the classes for
          the coming week. This gave us time to bounce ideas off each other, discuss
          waht students needed more work on, and divide the prep work that had to be done
          before class. I learned a lot about teaming and working with others in a teaching
          setting that I hadn't had as much exposure to before.
          <br>
          As well as co-teaching, I also taught some solo classes. I had a storytelling
          class everyweek with the kindergardeners. In this class I would read Englsih
          stories and use flashcards with the students. Throughout the first semester I
          was able to experiment and found what worked best with the students to hold
          their attention and make sure they were having fun with English.
          <img src="images/teaching/birthday.jpg" alt="three students, back to, drawing on a blackboard"
          style="width:200px; float: right; margin: 5px">
          <br><br>
           We would sing head, shoulders, knees, and toes (their favorite!), run around the
          classroom to point out different colors, and act out different animals
          before reading the book I chose. I had a lot of fun bring motion and simple
          games to the English language so that it was more exciting for them. After the
          first semester I was able to develop a routine with the students so we all
          knew generally waht to expect each day. Some days they remembered better than me!
          I also had a solo class with my 3rd graders and another with my 4th grader. For
          at least one year with each we spent that class learning to read a more difficult
          book and reviewing concepts they may have needed a little more help with.
          <img src="images/teaching/race.jpg" alt="students in matching green school shirts standing in a clump in preperation for a run"
          style="width:200px; float: left; margin: 5px">
          My third graders spent a full semester learning to read and understand a
          longer, more challenging picture book. We then spent the second semester turning
          it into a readers theater. This gave them the opportunity to practice speaking new
          English words in a more conversational way than they might typically use. I spent
          more time with the fourth graders on understanding the story fully. After reading
          a page I would ask them questions about what we read. This prompted critical
          reading skills and working to understand words in context, not just on their own.
          <br><br>
          Teaching these solo classes gave me a lot of opportunity to develop my own
          teaching style and methodologies. I struggled a lot with classroom management
          at first. It was particularly tricky since I only spoke English with the students
          which made it more difficult to repremand and talk through problems with them.
          <img src="images/teaching/teaching.jpg" alt="Gretchen standing in a group of students"
          style="width:200px; float: right; margin: 5px">
          This extra challenge deffinitly made me test different management styles to find what
          worked. It helped to show me not one style can work with every class and certain
          students respond better to different management styles. The language barrier with
          the students,though difficult, gave me a lot of ideas and confidence in teach
          students. It forced me to find a lot fo different ways to explain and show every
          concept so that they could better understand without any Mandarine. I know I can
          translate these skills to English speaking students because even with one
          language, all students learn in different ways. It is always a good idea to be
          prepared to teach and show examples in many ways,
          not just one.
